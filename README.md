## EXECUTION STEPS AND ITS OUTPUT:
Social Engineering attacks are the various cons used by the hackers to trick people into providing sensitive data to the attackers.

**Steps to Use SET for Phishing (Credential Harvester Attack Method)**

**1. Open terminal:**
```bash
sudo setoolkit
```
**2. Navigate:**
```bash
1) Social-Engineering Attacks  
2) Website Attack Vectors  
3) Credential Harvester Attack Method  
```
**3. Enter your IP address as the attacker server.**
**4. Choose:**
```bash
2) Site Cloner
```
**5. Enter the URL of the legitimate site ```(e.g., https://accounts.google.com)```**

**6. Send the generated link to the victim.**

**7. Once the victim logs in → their credentials are stored in:**
```bash
/var/www/html/
```



## RESULT:
The Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) is used to create backdoor is  examined successfully
